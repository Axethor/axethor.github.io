			<h1>Playable Characters</h1>
			<p>In Borderlands you have four playable characters to pick from. Brick the Berserker, Lilith the Siren, Mordecai the Hunter, 
			and Roland the Soldier. Any class can use any weapon in the game, but they each have their own special skills and abilities that 
			favor certain weapon types over others. Each class is heavily customizable while still retaining their core gameplay patterns.</p>
			<img src="brick.jpg" class="characters">
			<a id="berserker"><h2>Berserker</h2></a>
			<p>Brick is a close range unit that excels with explosives, shotguns, and his own fists. His class ability is Berserk, which 
			makes the screen tint red, he holsters his weapons, and pummels his enemies to death in melee combat. To survive melee combat his defences 
			and health regeneration are increased dramatically. Many of the Berserker's talents allow him to become more tanky and resist more damage, 
			so he is best played as a tank or close combat brawler.</p>
			<img src="lilith.jpg" class="characters">
			<a id="siren"><h2>Siren</h2></a>
			<p>Lilith is another close range unit, but one more suited to assassination and high burst damage than tanking and sustained brawling. Her 
			class ability is Phasewalk, which allows her to turn invisible for short periods of time and she gains a movement speed boost. This allows 
			her to weave in and out of combat while sustaining little damage. Upon entering and exiting her invisible state, she also creates an Area of 
			Effect damage ability centered around her character. She can profitiently use any weapon, with elemental weapons giving the greatest damage 
			increase of all, and he talents allow her to specialize in many different styles of assassination.</p>
			<img src="mordecai.jpg" class="characters">
			<a id="hunter"><h2>Hunter</h2></a>
			<p>Mordecai is a long range sniper unit. He can make use of other weapons, but his best talents lie in sniper rifles and pistols. His active 
			ability, Bloodwing, summons a bird pet that can damage enemies. Bloodwing is not permanent and can only be summoned for specific periods of 
			time. This time limit increases as his skill ranks up and with talents. Whether sniping from long range or optimizing the damage output of 
			Bloodwing, Mordecai likes to stay far out of danger and let others take it for him.</p>
			<img src="roland.jpg" class="characters">
			<a id="soldier"><h2>Soldier</h2></a>
			<p>Roland is a bit of a jack of all trades. He has no specific weapon he excels with, and he has many abilities that provide support for a 
			team instead of personal buffs. His active ability, Scorpio Turret, creates a sentry gun at the target location. The gun will fire against 
			and damage enemies, and has a shield you and your allies can hide behind for protection. Based on your talent choices, Roland can provide another 
			source of damage, a wide range of teamwide buffs, or a range of healing and regeneration abilities for you and your team mates. He is the most 
			varied of the four classes but also the most powerful in co-operative play.</p>
