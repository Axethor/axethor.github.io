			<p>Five Years have passed since the ending of the first Borderlands Game. A man named Handsome Jack has become the head of the Hyperion 
			Corporation, claims to have found the Vault from the first game, and made himself the Leader of Pandora. It is he who hires the new 
			set of Vault Hunters, only to betray them as they arrive on the planet. These new Vault Hunters have come to Pandora to find a second 
			Vault. Throughout your travels through Pandora, you run up against Jack's forces who repeatedly try to kill you. You join the Resistance, 
			who are seeking to remove Jack from power and save Pandora. Their leader is Roland, one of the original Vault Hunters. All four of the 
			original Vault Hunters have a part to play in the story.</p>
			<a id="gameplay"><h2>Gameplay</h2></a>
			<p>The game is a First Person Shooter. Up to 4 players can play together at a time. The games difficulty scales based on the amount of 
			players present, and anyone can drop out of join up at any time. During some parts of the game, combat vehicles can be used, and it switches to a 
			third person view. Your character levels up through earning experience like in a standard Role Playing Game. There are also a variety of weapons
			to be found and used. Experience and weapons are earned by completing mission and killing enemies. You can also by standard weapons from various 
			vendors, but they are usually inferior to quest rewards and dropped weapons.</p>
			<p>You complete missions by finding the required objective(s) or killing the required amount of enemies. You can do multiple missions at once, 
			with many objective quests having a kill quest to go with it. This makes questing easier and faster than doing each one at a time.</p>
