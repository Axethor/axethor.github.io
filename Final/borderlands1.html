			<p>In the year 5252, the planet Pandora is hailed as a planet rich in resources and potential. Many colonists head out to plunder it's
			riches, only to wind a mostly barren wasteland instead. Since then, those who stayed are at constant odds with the native creatures as 
			well as the criminals let loose when the mining companies left the planet. The only hope the colonists have lies in the mysterious Vault. 
			Said to contain vast stores of alien technology, it's location was lost right after being discovered when all the men who found it were 
			killed by it's defences.</p>
			<p>Your character is a Vault Hunter. One of the many treasure hunters who have come to Pandora to find the Vault and open it to claim its 
			riches. You make your way across Pandora searching for clues to the Vault's location. On your journey you help many of the colonists with their 
			various problems for money and better weapons.</p>
			<a id="gameplay"><h2>Gameplay</h2></a>
			<p>The game is a First Person Shooter. Up to 4 players can play together at a time. The games difficulty scales based on the amount of 
			players present, and anyone can drop out of join up at any time. During some parts of the game, combat vehicles can be used, and it switches to a 
			third person view. Your character levels up through earning experience like in a standard Role Playing Game. There are also a variety of weapons
			to be found and used. Experience and weapons are earned by completing mission and killing enemies. You can also by standard weapons from various 
			vendors, but they are usually inferior to quest rewards and dropped weapons.</p>
			<p>You complete missions by finding the required objective(s) or killing the required amount of enemies. You can do multiple missions at once, 
			with many objective quests having a kill quest to go with it. This makes questing easier and faster than doing each one at a time.</p>
