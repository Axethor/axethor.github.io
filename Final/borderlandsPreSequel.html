			<p>The Pre-sequel takes place inbetween the events of Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2. It chronicles Handsome Jack's rise to power within 
			Hyperion, and his search for a Vault hidden on Pandora's moon Elpis. You wander the lunar landscape under Jack's guidance, as you search 
			for the long lost Vault and claim what lies within.</p>
			<a id="gameplay"><h2>Gameplay</h2></a>
			<p>The game is a First Person Shooter. Up to 4 players can play together at a time. The games difficulty scales based on the amount of 
			players present, and anyone can drop out of join up at any time. During some parts of the game, combat vehicles can be used, and it switches to a 
			third person view. Your character levels up through earning experience like in a standard Role Playing Game. There are also a variety of weapons
			to be found and used. Experience and weapons are earned by completing mission and killing enemies. You can also by standard weapons from various 
			vendors, but they are usually inferior to quest rewards and dropped weapons.</p>
			<p>You complete missions by finding the required objective(s) or killing the required amount of enemies. You can do multiple missions at once, 
			with many objective quests having a kill quest to go with it. This makes questing easier and faster than doing each one at a time.</p>
